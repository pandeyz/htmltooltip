            <h3>What is tooltip?</h3>
            <p>
                The <code>tooltip</code> or <code>infotip</code> or a hint is a common graphical user interface element. It is used in conjunction with a cursor, usually a pointer. The user hovers the pointer over an item, without clicking it, and a tooltip may appearâ€”a small "hover box" with information about the item being hovered over.

            <h3>What's new about this?</h3>
            <p>
                There are so many plug-ins available to show tooltip on your webpage in which one can show <code>text</code> of any length on tooltip. But as the name suggest you can show <code>text</code> as well as <code>html</code> like <code>image</code> and <code>anchors</code> in tooltip.

            <h3>How this is possible?</h3>        
            <p>
                This is possible by just including a light weight fully configured jquery library with your code and just call its functionality and its done!
